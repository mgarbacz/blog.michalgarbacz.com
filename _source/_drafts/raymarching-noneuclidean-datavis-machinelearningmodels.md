# Ray Marching for light speed visualization

# Ray Marching vs Ray Tracing

# Ray Tracking In One Weekend

# Ray Marching vs Ray Tracing part 2

# Ray Marching
- a way to write down points in the space (a model for the space)
- signed distance functions (SDFs) for the objects in the world
- a way to move a given distance along a ray

# Ray Marching for Non-euclidean space

# Non-euclidean space for Machine Learning models

# Can visualizing this in 3D help with explainability
